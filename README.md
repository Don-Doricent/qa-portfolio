## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

This portfolio was built to show not just that I understand QA workflows — but that I can apply them to real projects and communicate bugs clearly to technical and non-technical audiences.

All work here is based on an actual client site, and reflects how I approach testing with intention, attention to detail, and user impact in mind.
